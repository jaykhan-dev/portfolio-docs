## Marketing material

### Project details

The following projects were material made for marketing and branding purposes. The tools I used were Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.

A client would either send in their requests and I would make the design based on that or sometimes it was up to me. Having creative freedom is the part that I enjoy the most. I usually search online for inspiration and find something that could work. Having a reference helps in improving my skills as a designer.
