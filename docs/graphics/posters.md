Print Three is a Canadian company that provides print, web, and marketing services. I was employed as a graphic designer but I also did a lot of UX research because the company was looking to expand into the web market. The reasons were obvious as most business nowadays in conducted online and print material has a dedicated clientele.

> The Print Three location in Ottawa is owner operated and caters to many different kinds of clients, including students, corporate clients, government clients at all levels of government, and many others.

### Concept 1
