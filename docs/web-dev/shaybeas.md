## Company details

Shaybeas Enterprises is a real estate company in Florida, USA. They specialize in taking leads and turning them into clients. Their unique business model involves using a CRM to build relationships with home sellers and buyers.

The client requested a Star Trek themed design. The inspiration was from [First Contact](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117731/)

## Zapier

[Zapier](https://zapier.com/) is a cool application that allows you to automate mundane tasks like setting up email alerts. In this case, the client used Zapier to populate the CRM that he was using. The first step was to collect the data in order to make business decisions, which were to pitch to a lead or referral based on their current needs.
