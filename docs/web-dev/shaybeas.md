[See design](https://shaybeas.webflow.io)

This version is the original design I made with Webflow. I have since stopped using Webflow because it is limited in its free plan. Considering I planned on making many websites and apps, this would easily add up to hundreds if not thousands of dollars. Besides I'm much more interested in writing code anyways.

## Company details

Shaybeas Enterprises is a real estate company in Florida, USA. They specialize in taking leads and turning them into clients. Their unique business model involves using a CRM to build relationships with home sellers and buyers.

The client requested a Star Trek themed design. The inspiration was from [First Contact](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117731/)
